# Social Music

## Introduction

### Problem statements 
Listening to music is a big part of socializing today. Although this is the case, there is no easy way for people to share and comment on their favorite music, on a unified platform. There are also no platforms made for keeping up with all artists and groups. People also spend a lot of time listening to the same music because it can be daunting to find more music they like. Finding new music can be difficult, and keeping up with new albums, singles, and music videos can get overwhelming. 

### Proposed solution 
Social Music is a website where users keep track of the music they listen to and view user-made libraries. Users can connect with others who have a similar taste in music, talk about new releases, and rate/review albums. Users can also keep track of what their friends are listening to, and what music is currently trending. 

### Novelty 
Music services like Spotify, Apple music, or YouTube Music allow users to share your account of saved albums, and playlists. But don’t have any functionality for socialization or leaving a rating/review. Our platform attempts to integrate a social aspect to these applications, allowing users to have more of a social feel to listening to music, allowing communities to comment on music and keep up with their favorite artists.

## Getting Started
### Installation and Setup
The command scripts below will explain how to start the project.
- In the client folder run npm start and in the server folder run nodemon server.js for development.
- To build the application run npm run build in the client folder and put those files along with the server files on a server.

### Run
#### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Database Create Scripts
A list of SQL Create scripts can be found in the SocialMusic_CreateScripts.txt file in the main file directory.
